Repo 1: Lichess
https://github.com/lichess-org/lila
A web based chess game using html5 and java. This interests me because I imagined chess to be realatively simple, but there are a bunch of files all doing differesnt things. I would imagin it's also more complicate because it is web based and it has online multiplayer. I don't understand what all the files are for, but one day I hope to have at least a basic understanding about how to make file sturctures like these, what all the file extensions mean, and what files do what. 

Repo 2: spaceShooter
https://github.com/tasdikrahman/spaceShooter#demo
This was a repo I found on github about a 2d spaceshooter made in python. I found it interesting because it is just the code with no exe or anything to run the game. You have to get a seperate zip with files specifit to your OS in order to actually play the game

Repo 3: Doom
https://github.com/id-Software/DOOM
sorce code for the original Doom. I think it's intertesting how it was writen in the original C language. Before there was c# and c++. Also there's no exe again. you need a real copy of the game in order to run the sorce code. That way you still have to buy the game, instead of just downloading the code for free.

Repo 4: Open-Golf
https://github.com/mgerdes/Open-Golf
Another game made in C. This one has a .bat that builds an exe so you can run the game. I was not abe to get it to work, but there are ones for eash os as well and i think that's cool.

Repo 5:Space Station 14
https://github.com/space-wizards/space-station-14
A recration of a game called Space Station 13, made with C#. I'm suprised how much bigger this was compared to all the other repos. Even the doom one wasn't as big.
